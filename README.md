# my-pi-hole-block-list

This is my pi-hole block list, the major contributer will be my son, because I will check which game/video site he is playing/watching, and then add it to this list. :)

Feel free to send pull request to this repo so we (or our kids) can build the block list to help our kids focusing on online class.
